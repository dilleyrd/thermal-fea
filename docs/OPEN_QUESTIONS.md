# Open questions

Questions and decisions that the plan documents do not settle (Plan §4 rules 2, 3, 6, 9, 11).
Each entry says what was done in the meantime, so a reviewer can confirm or overrule it.

## Q1 — `Material` field order (Data §6) — raised in M1.8

Data §6 lists the fields of `Material` as `name, k, k2 = None, rho, cp, phase_change = None`.
A dataclass cannot have a field without a default (`rho`) after one with a default (`k2`).

**Done for now:** `k2` and `phase_change` are keyword-only fields, so the signature is
`Material(name, k, rho, cp, *, k2=None, phase_change=None)`. Every call written with
keywords, as in the data model, works unchanged. Field names, types and defaults are as
specified.

**To confirm:** that keyword-only `k2` / `phase_change` is acceptable, or give the
intended positional order.

## Q2 — fluid names in the built-in library (Data §6) — raised in M1.8

The data model heads the two fluid tables "Air at 1 atm" and "Water, saturated liquid" but
does not give the `name` stored in `fluids.json`.

**Done for now:** the names are `"Air"` and `"Water"`; lookups by `library.fluid(name)` and
`library.solid(name)` ignore case.
